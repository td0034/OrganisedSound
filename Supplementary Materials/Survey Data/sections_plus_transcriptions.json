When there were dissonant tones playing at the same time, it was more 'interesting' in the sound modality than in the lights modality (e.g. introduction of a green to predominantly purple/red colour combinations).\n\nOverall, the creation of the piece this time was more intuition driven, and I was not 'thinking' about what would sound good given my background music theory knowledge."

It was less clear why small changes in scale tones used led to large cascades in near-neighbour activation. Essentially it felt like a set of stable ('solid') states separated by high disorganisation in the states ('gas/liquid' states).",
      "expectation_vs_outcome": "The light modality was more organised than I expected for the majority of the piece, revealing repeated spatial patterns when tones had more pleasing scale intervals. It felt like the pattern of light placements added an extra dimension/dynamicism to the piece, as they shifted between ordered spatially repeating patterns, separated by times of high activity/randomness that corresponded to dissonance and (at those times) overwhelming sound arrangements. \nThe spatial extent of the light patterns (how many lights were active at any one time) were surprising given how few notes were playing (between shifts) - this actually added to the experience as one note playing activated multiple lights it created something more interesting to look at."

      "reflection": "On watching back the pieces, what felt most satisfying was the close association between sound and light, rather than coherence of the sound to resemble a piece of music (which I expected beforehand). This said, it was important to have some periods of tonal coherence, because it enabled me to focus in on the more static associations (I think just having high activity/dynamics of light and sound would be overhwelming and not satisfying). \nI think that it would be possible to discern (better than at random) which piece corresponded to which modality being available, based on which modality dominated the experience when reviewing the piece. \nPerhaps it is because of habituation to using the tool, but I felt that when both modalities were available (my first attempt), it was in a sense overwhelming to 'compose' with sound and visuals simultaneously, i.e. trying to make them both look/sound good at the same time.
