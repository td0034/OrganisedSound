Most of these I would find interesting as a live performance as long as there was variation throughout the live set. If it was that one clip or v similar for the whole performance that would be less compelling but I don\u2019t think any liver performance is like that in reality.\n\nI ended up rating based on what I thought fitted that environment / setting best.\n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t choose this option often based on the above but I believe that almost all of these could be used for workshop / education as the actual output is less important there in my opinion. I chose this mostly where it didn\u2019t fit into the other three categories.\n\nFinal thing - I listened to most of these through a nice set of over ear headphones. For comparison\u2019s sake I did side by side tests of a couple with laptop speakers and much preferred the headphone version - the bass notes come through much clearer and make the whole thing more balanced",

More enjoyable to watch because of synchronization, however pacing/speed of delivery was VERY fast and became overstimulating once audio paired with visual. I think the visual was especially fatiguing bouncing around, though it helped to have less color saturation on the hexagon revealing more pattern. With the audio, the overstimulation came from discontinuity between high sounds and low sounds with seemingly no order or grounding feature. The only grounding feature to me was the fact that audio and visuals were in sync.",

I thought it may have been more human composed, but perhaps there were more parameters on harmonicity for a computer-driven algorithmic composition. It felt hypnotic and was the first clip I wanted to replay, and played/watched/listened twice. I thought it would be suitable for background ambiance or an installation. I am finding the synth sound used a little harsh throughout all clips - but this composition was more enjoyable and felt like wind chimes.",

However, since I was focused in this study, the randomness of color location captured most of my attention and detracted from my enjoyment of the audio composition.",
