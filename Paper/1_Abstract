Electroacoustic audiovisual composition frequently aspires to parity between sound and moving image, yet compositional workflows and perceptual salience often reintroduce hierarchy, positioning one medium as structural and the other as illustrative. Responding to calls to reconceptualise media relationships through intermediality, this article examines intermedial interference—constructive and destructive interactions between media features—as an evaluable property of generative audiovisual instruments. We study a Tonnetz cellular automata (CA) system in which sound and LED-panel activity are produced as parallel projections of a single evolving state-space. Participants shaped the system by adjusting a compact parameter set governing population bounds, neighbourhood extent, neighbour-rule thresholds, update rate, activation lifetimes, recurrence (looping) and harmonic admissibility (scale). Using a within-subject design, each participant completed three short compositional tasks under controlled modality-access conditions (visual-only, audio-only, audiovisual). In all conditions, both audio and video were recorded and end-state parameter presets saved. Participants reported perceived coherence, novelty, agency, fusion/equality and interference, followed by immediate replay-based reflection with both modalities present. Outputs were subsequently rated by independent observers using blind presentation, and baseline system-alone captures provided a control for intrinsic generativity. We outline an analysis framework linking participant experience to perceivable artefacts and propose an interference taxonomy grounded in parameter regimes and observed compositional strategies. The study offers a practical evaluation method for practice-based intermedial research and a state-space projection framing of audiovisual composition in which sound and light operate as co-equal media.
