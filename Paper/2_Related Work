2.1 Intermediality and “media equality” as a relational claim

Intermediality is often invoked to describe work that occurs “between” media, but its analytic value depends on specifying which intermedial relation is at stake. Rajewsky treats intermediality as a research lens and proposes a typology (medial transposition, media combination, intermedial reference) that helps avoid collapsing distinct practices into a single “multimedia” category (Rajewsky 2005). In this paper, the focus is media combination—sound and time-based light output co-present—and, more specifically, whether participants and observers experience the combined outcome as co-constitutive rather than one medium functioning as explanatory support for the other. The Organised Sound call sharpened this as a “media equality” problem: how meaning is produced when media are fused rather than merely juxtaposed (Organised Sound 2026).

Elleström’s modality model provides a useful scaffold for discussing equality without treating media as undifferentiated streams. By distinguishing material, sensorial, spatiotemporal, and semiotic modalities, the model makes it possible to describe where equality succeeds or fails: parity may hold in causal origin (both derive from the same substrate) but collapse in sensorial salience (one dominates attention) or semiotic authority (one is treated as the “real” carrier of form) (Elleström 2010). The present study adopts this precision: “equality” is treated as negotiated and contingent, not assumed.

2.2 Audiovisual relations: integration, framing, and interpretive hierarchy

Audiovisual theory in film and sound studies provides durable concepts for how sound and image are perceived as an integrated whole. Chion’s account of audio-vision emphasises that audiovisual perception is not additive; sound and image reciprocally frame one another’s meaning (Chion 1994). This is directly relevant to a modality-withholding design: composing with one modality absent and reinstating it at replay makes the construction of audio-vision observable, including how expectation, surprise, and retrospective binding contribute to perceived unity.

Intermedial frameworks also emphasise analysing relations between media—how they align, diverge, reinforce, or contradict—rather than presuming stable hierarchies such as accompaniment/illustration (Rajewsky 2005; Elleström 2010). These accounts legitimise treating audience interpretation as primary evidence for intermedial success, and they align with the paper’s focus on interference effects that emerge as relational phenomena rather than technical synchronisation achievements.

2.3 Intermedial interference as an evaluable property of coupled instruments

The Organised Sound call foregrounds “intermedial interference” as a prompt for reconceptualising media relationships, including constructive and destructive interactions between media features (Organised Sound 2026). Chiaramonte develops the term within electroacoustic audiovisual composition, treating the intermedial interaction itself as the compositional site and noting the difficulty of measurability when interference is phenomenological and context-dependent (Chiaramonte 2024).

The present study extends this line by focusing on a coupled generative instrument in which sound and light are parallel media projections of a single evolving state-space. This coupling makes interference design-sensitive: parameter regimes, constraint conditions, and control affordances can shift interference from productive fusion (reinforcement, heightened legibility, surprise-as-rebinding) to destructive conflict (contradictory cues, masking, reduced causal confidence). The within-subject modality-access manipulation is used to render these shifts tractable in practice-based evaluation.

2.4 Multisensory binding, crossmodal correspondences, and “cue” mechanisms

Work in multisensory perception suggests that binding depends on which cues are treated as reliable evidence for a shared causal story. Crossmodal correspondences offer a complementary design lens: Spence’s tutorial review synthesises evidence that people reliably associate features across modalities (e.g., pitch–brightness), making correspondences a resource for designing legible mappings rather than an anecdotal curiosity (Spence 2011). For the present instrument, correspondences help explain why some participants may use colour similarity as a proxy for harmonic planning, and why constraint conditions can reweight which cues dominate attention and inference.

2.5 Agency, co-creativity, and evaluation traditions in DMIs and generative systems

Generative and autonomous instruments often trade direct predictability for novelty and emergence, prompting an agency negotiation in which performers steer rather than command. Evaluation traditions in DMIs provide precedents for studying this without reducing outcomes to usability metrics. O’Modhrain proposes an evaluation framework for digital musical instruments that supports structured reflection on experience and capability while remaining sensitive to musical context (O’Modhrain 2011). Orio and Wanderley similarly discuss evaluation of input devices for musical expression, offering method rationales that bridge performer experience and system design iteration (Orio and Wanderley 2002).

This lineage motivates the paper’s mixed-method approach (self-report tied to captured artefacts) and supports Strategy A’s stance on external ratings: independent audience assessment is framed as a principled extension for triangulation, but not required for the core claims of the present results.

2.6 Tonnetz and cellular automata as compositional substrates

The Tonnetz has a substantial theoretical lineage within neo-Riemannian and transformational theory, providing a well-motivated harmonic space in which neighbourhood relations correspond to parsimonious voice-leading transformations. Cohn’s account of neo-Riemannian operations and Tonnetz representations provides a canonical grounding for treating Tonnetz geometry as more than a “clever layout” (Cohn 1997). Douthett and Steinbach’s work on parsimonious graphs further reinforces the status of these geometries as analytical and compositional structures rather than purely visualisations (Douthett and Steinbach 1998).

Cellular automata also have a long-standing lineage as musical generative formalisms, valued for producing emergent structure from simple local rules. Miranda’s chapter on cellular automata music provides a clear anchor for positioning CA as a legitimate compositional engine spanning sound generation and higher-level form (Miranda 2007). In the present system, the distinctive move is to treat CA state as an intermedial score: the same evolving substrate is rendered simultaneously as sound and as time-based light activity, enabling interference to be observed as an emergent property of coupled projections under constraint.
