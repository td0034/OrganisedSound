2.1. Intermediality and the problem of “media equality”
Intermediality is routinely invoked to signal work that happens between media rather than alongside them. Rajewsky frames intermediality as an umbrella term for “phenomena that … take place between media”, emphasising that the concept is heterogeneous and best treated as a research lens rather than a single technique. epe.lac-bac.gc.ca In the Organised Sound call, this lens is explicitly tied to the ambition that sound and image operate as equals in an “Intermedial Space”, where meaning is mutually shaped rather than hierarchically assigned. Cambridge University Press & Assessment
A useful way to avoid vague appeals to “between-ness” is Elleström’s modality model, which distinguishes media by material, sensorial, spatiotemporal and semiotic modalities, allowing intermedial relations to be discussed as specific kinds of border-crossings, couplings and transformations rather than general hybridity. Springer Link This matters for your paper because your system is not merely “sound plus lights”: it is a time-based visual modality (spatiotemporal patterning in light) and an auditory modality (pitch/timbre/time), coupled through a shared generative substrate. Framing the work in modality terms helps you argue that intermediality is enacted at the level of causality (shared state-space) and perception (co-attended streams), not simply at the level of presentation.
Intermedial discourse also intersects with remediation: how media reuse, refashion, or foreground mediation itself (often framed through immediacy/hypermediacy). paas.org.pl This is relevant to Organised Sound’s emphasis on the ethics and politics of remediated source materials, but it also matters more practically: generative audiovisual instruments can oscillate between transparency (“I am directly shaping the work”) and foregrounded mediation (“the system is visibly doing things to me”). That oscillation is a principal driver of perceived agency and, in your terms, intermedial interference.
2.2. Audiovisual relations: from film sound to musical multimedia
Audiovisual theory in film studies provides durable concepts for understanding how sound and image combine into a trans-sensory whole. Chion’s “audio-vision” positions audiovisual perception as an integrated mode in which sound can shape the perceived meaning of images and vice versa, rather than being treated as separable channels. Columbia University Press This orientation aligns well with the call’s intermedial space framing and supports your methodological move of testing what happens when one modality is withheld during composition and reinstated only at replay: the study becomes an experiment in how audio-vision is constructed, anticipated, and retrospectively interpreted.
In musicology and multimedia analysis, Cook argues for analysing how media work together rather than presuming stable hierarchies, offering a vocabulary for relations that are not reducible to “illustration” or “accompaniment”. PhilArchive This line of work is useful to you in two ways: (i) it legitimises the analytical stance that intermedial meaning arises from relations (alignment, divergence, reinforcement, contradiction), and (ii) it provides a precedent for treating audience interpretation as central evidence rather than a secondary “reception” add-on.
Organised Sound has also carried related discussions in adjacent form, including attention to the visual/material conditions of sound-based practices (e.g., accounts that interrogate what “audiovisual” entails once physical artefacts and staging become central to sonic art). Cambridge University Press & Assessment That thread helps you justify LED-panel composition as squarely within the journal’s remit even when the visual component is not conventional moving-image video: it is still time-based visual structuring integral to the work’s signification.
2.3. Electroacoustic legacies: concrète, acousmatics and the “image” of sound
A key part of the call is the suggestion that musique concrète thinking can be extended across sonic and visual domains—abstracting materials from reality while retaining traces of origin. Cambridge University Press & Assessment Your system is not concrète in the strict Schaefferian sense (it is not founded on recorded sound objects), but the logic is transferable: constraint, transformation, and the play between mimesis and abstraction can be recast as the play between recognisable musical structures (scales, harmonic neighbourhoods) and abstracted generative behaviour (CA emergence and recurrence).
Within electroacoustic analysis, Smalley’s spectromorphology provides an established descriptive language grounded in perception and motion-in-time, and it is explicitly concerned with how listeners infer source and causality (e.g., via “source-bonding”). York University This is directly relevant to your evaluation: participants and raters will likely form causal stories about what is “driving” what (lights driving sound, sound driving lights, or an unseen system driving both). Those inferences are not noise; they are the mechanism by which intermedial equality or hierarchy is reconstructed in perception.
Related Organised Sound work on electroacoustic imagery and space similarly underscores that electroacoustic practice frequently deals in evocation, place, and image-like listening, even when no visuals are present. ACM Digital Library This gives you a strong bridge to your “audio-only” and “visual-only” task conditions: each condition invites participants to construct a partial world-model, which is then tested against the reinstated audiovisual whole at replay.
2.4. Intermedial interference and the intermedial space
The thematic call points to “Intermedial Interference” as a recent contribution: constructive and/or destructive interaction of different media features. Cambridge University Press & Assessment Chiaramonte’s doctoral research develops this concept in the specific context of electroacoustic audiovisual composition, positioning intermedial practice as one in which the in-between—the interaction itself—becomes the compositional site. Bournemouth University Research Online Two aspects of Chiaramonte’s framing are particularly consequential for your paper.
First, it motivates an analysis that is not primarily about synchronisation as a technical achievement, but about how interaction produces perceptual and interpretive consequences (reinforcement, masking, contradiction, overload, narrative leakage, etc.). Second, it highlights an evaluative gap: if interference is phenomenological and context-sensitive, it is easy to describe but hard to compare across works or design choices. Chiaramonte explicitly notes the difficulty of measurability and the potential value of broader audience reception work. Bournemouth University Research Online Your design answers that need pragmatically by triangulating (i) compositional experience, (ii) artefact properties (captured clips and saved parameter states), and (iii) independent ratings.
2.5. Multisensory perception: synchrony, binding and crossmodal correspondences
A substantial body of perceptual research indicates that audiovisual integration is shaped by temporal tolerance, stimulus type, attention, and prior exposure. Vatakis and Spence’s work on audiovisual synchrony perception demonstrates that tolerance for asynchrony varies across classes of events (including musical actions), implying that “tight sync” is neither a universal requirement nor a sufficient condition for perceived integration. PubMed This is useful for interpreting your outcomes: if raters judge a clip as “fused” even when participants composed under modality deprivation, the explanation may lie less in explicit alignment and more in emergent structural correspondence or learned binding.
Separately, research on crossmodal correspondences shows that people reliably associate features across senses (e.g., pitch–brightness, timbre–shape, etc.), and Spence’s review work is a strong anchor for positioning such correspondences as a design resource rather than an anecdotal curiosity. SAGE Journals In your dyad rationale—“people are better at recognising colour similarity than note similarity”—the more defensible claim (in an OS paper) is not that colour is inherently “easier”, but that visual similarity judgments and categorical naming can support shared reference and negotiation in ways that may translate into more coherent parameter steering under time pressure. The dyad method then tests whether that negotiation advantage carries through to externally perceived audiovisual quality.
2.6. Agency, co-creativity and evaluation in generative instruments
Organised Sound readers will recognise the recurring tension in generative systems between autonomy and steerability: systems can be expressive because they surprise, yet frustrating because they resist direct intention. Contemporary NIME literature increasingly treats this as a question of co-creative agency and collaborative process rather than “control accuracy”. For example, ethnographic and process-focused studies of machine collaboration emphasise how musicians negotiate authorship, trust, and shared direction over extended work. NIME More general computational-creativity literature similarly foregrounds creativity as situated practice rather than an intrinsic property of an algorithm. Frontiers
On evaluation specifically, the DMI community has repeatedly argued that informal assessments dominate and that structured evaluation frameworks are needed to generate comparable knowledge while respecting musical context. O’Modhrain’s evaluation framework is widely cited in this space and provides a defensible reference point for articulating what your study evaluates (experience, capability, context) without collapsing into usability testing. ACM Digital Library Complementary work proposes performer- and audience-oriented evaluation approaches (including structured measures and triangulation across perspectives). NIME+1 Brown et al.’s meta-review of music interaction evaluations further supports your motivation by documenting how much evaluation remains informal and which UX dimensions are typically under-examined. teamaxe.co.uk
Your contribution to this line is the modality-access manipulation (visual-only/audio-only/audiovisual) as a direct operationalisation of intermedial equality and interference, plus the linkage of participant experience to independent clip ratings—an approach that is legible to both Organised Sound and NIME/SMC audiences.
2.7. Tonnetz and cellular automata as compositional substrates
The Tonnetz has a substantial theoretical lineage in neo-Riemannian and transformational theory, and Cohn’s formalisation of Tonnetz spaces and parsimonious operations is a canonical reference for grounding your mapping as more than a “clever layout”. repmus.ircam.fr+1 In your system, the Tonnetz is not simply a visualisation of harmonic relations; it is an interaction scaffold that makes local neighbourhood operations musically meaningful under constrained exploration.
Cellular automata have likewise been explored as generative musical formalisms for decades. Miranda’s early work on music composition using cellular automata is a clear historical anchor for treating CA as a legitimate compositional engine rather than a novelty. Plymouth Research Portal Earlier ICMC work also demonstrates the long-standing interest in CA as a bridge between simple rules and emergent musical structure. Quod This tradition provides the backdrop against which your system’s distinctive move becomes clear: you are not merely using CA to generate notes; you are using CA as an intermedial score whose state is rendered simultaneously as sound and light, enabling interference to be studied as an emergent property of a coupled system.

2.1. Intermediality as a relational claim (not “multimedia” as co-presence)
Intermediality is frequently invoked to describe work that happens “between” media, but its analytical value depends on how precisely the relevant intermedial phenomenon is specified. Rajewsky argues that intermediality functions best as a lens for describing boundary-crossing phenomena, and she proposes a typology—medial transposition, media combination, and intermedial reference—to avoid collapsing distinct practices into a single umbrella term. Érudit+1 In this paper, the study is primarily concerned with media combination (sound and time-based visual output co-present) and with the ways intermedial meaning is produced when neither medium is treated as explanatory “support” for the other.
The Organised Sound thematic call intensifies this point by framing intermediality as a shift from juxtaposition to fusion, and by explicitly positioning sound and image as equals within an “Intermedial Space” in which meaning is mutually shaped rather than hierarchically assigned. Cambridge University Press & Assessment This paper takes that equality claim as the central problem to be investigated: not whether sound and image can be presented together, but whether they can be composed and perceived as co-constitutive.
2.2. “Media equality” across modalities: Elleström’s model as an analytic scaffold
To discuss equality without treating media as undifferentiated streams, Elleström’s modality model is useful because it specifies how media relate through material, sensorial, spatiotemporal, and semiotic modalities. Springer Nature Link This matters for intermedial equality because equality can fail (or succeed) at different levels. A work may be equal in material investment (both present), but unequal in sensorial salience (one dominates attention), or equal in salience but unequal in semiotic authority (one is treated as the “real” carrier of form).
In the present system, sound and light are produced as parallel projections of a shared evolving generative substrate. This establishes a form of causal parity (both modalities originate from the same state-space), but does not guarantee perceptual or interpretive parity. Elleström’s framework therefore supports the call’s demand for reconceptualisation by allowing the paper to ask: in what modalities is equality achieved, and where does it collapse into hierarchy? Springer Nature Link+1
2.3. Intermedial Space and intermedial interference
The call foregrounds Intermedial Interference—the constructive and/or destructive interaction of different media features—as a prompt for new critical frameworks. Cambridge University Press & Assessment Chiaramonte’s doctoral research develops “intermedial interference” in the specific context of electroacoustic audiovisual composition and positions the intermedial as a compositional site: interference describes how interactions between media features (e.g., temporal articulation, density, motion, segmentation cues) can amplify meaning or destabilise it. Bournemouth University Research Online+1
For this paper, intermedial interference is treated as an emergent property of a coupled system, and therefore as design-sensitive: mapping strategies, constraint regimes, and interaction affordances can shift whether interference is experienced as productive fusion or as competition/contradiction. This framing motivates an evaluation approach that does not reduce intermediality to synchronisation accuracy, but instead examines how participants shape (and retrospectively interpret) the fused audiovisual artefact under different access conditions.
2.4. Tonnetz “misleadingness” as productive interference: cognitive/HCI grounding
A further complication—especially relevant to Tonnetz-based instruments—is that the visual organisation is not a neutral display of theory; it can actively shape users’ mental models and expectations. Besada et al. examine the Tonnetz “at first sight” as a pitch-space interface through a cognitive/HCI lens, showing that while theoretical competence supports partial comprehension of Tonnetz structure, the geometry can also bias understanding, particularly when sequences do not align with functional-harmonic expectations. SAGE Journals+1
This result is directly valuable to an intermedial interference argument. In a system where the Tonnetz is simultaneously a harmonic scaffold and a time-based visual field, users may “overfit” the geometry—reading theoretical meaning into visually salient patterns. Such overfitting can be framed as destructive interference when it produces misleading causality or contradictory form cues, but it can equally be framed as constructive interference when it creates a generative space for exploratory interpretation and novel compositional direction. The present study is designed to operationalise this tension: if Tonnetz-driven visual structure shapes musical expectation, then composing with one modality withheld (audio-only or visual-only) and then replaying the full audiovisual result becomes a controlled way to observe how expectations are formed, violated, reconciled, and valued.
2.5. Remediation and the oscillation between transparency and foregrounded mediation
Rajewsky explicitly compares intermediality’s typology to Bolter and Grusin’s account of remediation, which describes how new media refashion prior media and how experiences can oscillate between transparency (immediacy) and conspicuous mediation (hypermediacy). Érudit+1 For generative audiovisual instruments, this oscillation is not merely historical; it is experiential. Interaction may feel transparent when cause-effect relations are graspable (“I am shaping the piece”), and hypermediated when the system’s autonomy becomes perceptually foregrounded (“the system is doing things to me”). This shift is a mechanism through which media hierarchy and interference are produced in practice, and it reinforces the need for an evaluation approach that captures both felt agency and perceived coherence of the resulting artefacts.
2.6. Positioning the present study
Taken together, these intermedial frameworks (Rajewsky; Elleström; the Organised Sound call; Chiaramonte) motivate treating “media equality” and “intermedial interference” as empirically tractable, without collapsing them into simple preference judgements. Bournemouth University Research Online+3Érudit+3Springer Nature Link+3 The study therefore evaluates how intermedial meaning-making behaves under controlled modality access, and how Tonnetz-driven visual structure may function as both a biasing force and a creative resource (Besada et al.).
