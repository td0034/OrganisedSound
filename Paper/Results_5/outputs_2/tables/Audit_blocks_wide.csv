The shared tonality was surprisingly consonant when colours where matched. When there were dissonant tones playing at the same time, it was more 'interesting' in the sound modality than in the lights modality (e.g. introduction of a green to predominantly purple/red colour combinations).

The spatial extent of the light patterns (how many lights were active at any one time) were surprising given how few notes were playing (between shifts) - this actually added to the experience as one note playing activated multiple lights it created something more interesting to look at.","It felt like at times of low sound activity there were more lights active than expected, although as I said, this was a positive in this instance rather than a negative contributor to experiencing the piece.

A big mismatch overall.,"The visual pattern did not match any auditory chonchordancy / harmony in any way that I would have predicted - they patterns of visuals and audio seem very separate. In addition, the pure tone perhaps meant that I could not hear the full complex nature of the sound that was clearly present and visible - perhaps because different octaves of the same note starting at the same time sounded as one. I could hear flurries of consecutive notes and perhaps different notes that coincided. I would be very interested to hear the outcome if these notes were more distinguishable, and likely would produce a much less busy piece!",2026-01-07 18:47:12.018113+00:00,3.3333333333333335,5.75,3.5
