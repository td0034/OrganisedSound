I think this is because while I have a basic understanding of the system, different parameters seeem to feed into the same outcome unless rules are followed. 

Despite this I really enjoyed the final playback as there were lots of interesting audio and visual outputs which were partially planned but also unexpected.","the middle section of the track didnt change much despite me playing around with a lot of parameters, after this by chance I stumbled accross a really interesting motiff which I was really pleased with","['Rate', 'Min Neighbours', 'Max Neighbours']",

It felt harder to control the system using purely sound, I think this is because I am a more visual person, however the build up of sound, even if random was fun and on review had more structure than maybe I realised during the process of recording.
Due to the speed of the lights and output produced, it felt like the sounds and audio had more of an impact. However I felt less in control of the sound during the recording.","No, it felt coherant. ","['Rate', 'Scale']",

4939Z,A,4939Z,A,A mix / unsure,"Overall strategy was more aimed at achieving pleasant patterns and combinations of colours on the tool (e.g. quickly turning off a colour after turning it on and seeing it doesn't fit). During use of the tool this time I felt like I played more with a narrative associated to the visual display, especially towards the end where I increased the frequency of lights active at one time, followed by an 'ending' which had less and less lights active as the piece was ending.","I expected the sound to be more dissonant than it was (i.e. a good matching between tones and light combinations - constructive intereference), this is probably related to the lights being kept on for longer than the associated sound was playing. At times (especially from the middle of the piece to the end) I did not find much association between light duration and note duration - destructive intereference.
The shared tonality was surprisingly consonant when colours where matched. When there were dissonant tones playing at the same time, it was more 'interesting' in the sound modality than in the lights modality (e.g. introduction of a green to predominantly purple/red colour combinations).

Overall, the creation of the piece this time was more intuition driven, and I was not 'thinking' about what would sound good given my background music theory knowledge.",Length of light activity was misleading for tone length which was shorter and did not match. ,"['Max Population', 'Min Population', 'Rate', 'Neighbourhood (Local/Extended)', 'Min Neighbours', 'Max Neighbours', 'Scale']",
4939Z,B,4939Z,B,Stability/clarity,I was aiming for finding pleasant melodies/harmonic movement by individual tones on and off together. I was not focusing on colour matching tones but instead relied on a mixture of trial and error and expectations of what tones would match based on music theory/harmony knowledge.,"The light modality was more organised than I expected for the majority of the piece, revealing repeated spatial patterns when tones had more pleasing scale intervals. It felt like the pattern of light placements added an extra dimension/dynamicism to the piece, as they shifted between ordered spatially repeating patterns, separated by times of high activity/randomness that corresponded to dissonance and (at those times) overwhelming sound arrangements. 
The spatial extent of the light patterns (how many lights were active at any one time) were surprising given how few notes were playing (between shifts) - this actually added to the experience as one note playing activated multiple lights it created something more interesting to look at.","It felt like at times of low sound activity there were more lights active than expected, although as I said, this was a positive in this instance rather than a negative contributor to experiencing the piece. It was less clear why small changes in scale tones used led to large cascades in near-neighbour activation. Essentially it felt like a set of stable ('solid') states separated by high disorganisation in the states ('gas/liquid' states).","['Neighbourhood (Local/Extended)', 'Min Neighbours', 'Max Neighbours', 'Life Length', 'Scale']",

During task I was influenced by which sounds to activate/deactivate based on the colour combinations being displayed - aiming for hue-similar colours to be simultaneously active.","The result was suprisingly interesting/mesmerising, I could feel my brain try to work out the pattern as well as surprise/'delight' as new patterns of chord tones and colour combinations emerged and changed throughout the piece.

In addition, the pure tone perhaps meant that I could not hear the full complex nature of the sound that was clearly present and visible - perhaps because different octaves of the same note starting at the same time sounded as one.

I had some inkling of this while playing but could see some impacts more clearly and unexpectedly in the review.","I am beginning to see why having neighbouring notes available results in simple repeating patterns and also dischordant sounds, and why having more harmony constrains the visuals under some game of life conditions, something about having the notes far enough away from each other meaning they are poor / unrelated neighbours.
