The shared tonality was surprisingly consonant when colours where matched. When there were dissonant tones playing at the same time, it was more 'interesting' in the sound modality than in the lights modality (e.g. introduction of a green to predominantly purple/red colour combinations).

It felt like the pattern of light placements added an extra dimension/dynamicism to the piece, as they shifted between ordered spatially repeating patterns, separated by times of high activity/randomness that corresponded to dissonance and (at those times) overwhelming sound arrangements. 
The spatial extent of the light patterns (how many lights were active at any one time) were surprising given how few notes were playing (between shifts) - this actually added to the experience as one note playing activated multiple lights it created something more interesting to look at.",Audio-only,5.0
