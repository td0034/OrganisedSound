5344J,C,B,Sound was the primary focus generally and the light was a happy accident or result when doing the audio visual ,Sound felt like a more dominant sensory driver and easier to get wrong.,"rate parameter is counter intuitive, lower is faster; hehe is it possible to break this thing?; is this real time?;somehow stuck on one (light);is this the vidoe? somehow feels different to what i remember (doing);a reset button for the parameters would be great; rate parameter is frustrating;"
5220H,C,B,I'd add unit to the valves and maybe try and scale them more equally and invert rate.  ,"I didnt think it would effect how I felt the performace went as much as it did. I felt less in control when I could see it but maybe its a positive bias that i have control when I see it and like it, but im not in control when I cant see it. I think this maybe differnt if I had done the peformances in a differnt order. Still have a question in my mind if I performed or the Tonnetz performed  ","that broke it (in response to momentary switch);sick (in response to rate parameter = 0);i find myslef wanting to understand it all, like what each thing is actually doing, rather than play with it; i want it to go real crazy; it is real crazy that; when its stuck and i add a note it plays all the different octaves; i like it wen it feels more random; with all the lights on its like having the inverse of having just a few on - if i couldnt see the visuals i woulnt know if they were mainly on or off; got some real deepness going on there;i feel the need to make nice music, in scale; when it goes crazy its a bit much but doenst matter if noone else is listening; id like to see units next to the parameters (on the control interface); i didnt get caught in the frustrating loops like can happen with modular synthesisers; interesting that im taking ownership of whats happening; input control (with mouse and web control app) is not amazingly tactile/ergonomic, on synths you can just pop a dial back if you make a mistake; in my head it sounded different, I feel like i should have known it would sound the way it did; my perception changes after answering these questions; i feel like im happy to take credit for it doing stuff when it does what i want it to do; (in response to sound only block) it definately feels like something missing, without the visuals it didnt feel like i was really in control;"
1661J,C,C,Incorporate A/D/S/R envelopes into the audio and visuals!,"Creativity can come from not fully understanding the parameters and playing around
Musical knowledge and theory is not required to make music and enjoy the creative process
Using the system I felt like I was experiencing audio and visual as a combined sense opposed to sensing them separately.
",loop on/off button not clear; much prefered the final outcome
3483M,Unsure,A,,"For me, the audio had to be removed completely before I could prioritise the visual - the audio was more important to my overall experience - the avoidance of overwhelm and generation of feelings of pleasure or balance.
Audio only was hardest - perhaps also because I did it first,  but perhaps because I had no other reference point to go by. 
I liked the sense of having control yet also being fully in imperfection and play and surprise.
I don't really understand the audio-visual relationship but already more than I did at the start. 
It's magic!
","you could just spend hours and hours; with the visuals turned off you have no idea; cant remember what anything does now; everytime i try to loop the whole thing stops; cant get anything to sound vaguely nice, not doing jazz anymore; dont have a choice but ot make something that doens sound nice; still dont understand what the parameters are doing; lets try turning them all on; quite a relief (playing without headphones on) because you know (just by looking that) it would be cacophonous; liked it when that blue note came in;emergence - imperfection to allow yourself to play is a good excercise regardless of output; nice to do it without sound;"
4939Z,B,B,"Having a default settings preset on the controller would be useful. Consider having a few presets that correspond to different audiovisual patterns that users can start from.

The scale tone colours in the controller do not match the instrument light colours as closely as I would have liked (especially yellow/green on the G/A side were basically identical in the controller). 

Note length slider does not correspond to the light activity duration (light carries on after note dies out), consider matching these more closely - adding variable light intensity might be a nice way to do this if changing the lights, or matching the tone duration to make it ring out for longer if changing the tones.","On watching back the pieces, what felt most satisfying was the close association between sound and light, rather than coherence of the sound to resemble a piece of music (which I expected beforehand). This said, it was important to have some periods of tonal coherence, because it enabled me to focus in on the more static associations (I think just having high activity/dynamics of light and sound would be overhwelming and not satisfying). 
I think that it would be possible to discern (better than at random) which piece corresponded to which modality being available, based on which modality dominated the experience when reviewing the piece. 
Perhaps it is because of habituation to using the tool, but I felt that when both modalities were available (my first attempt), it was in a sense overwhelming to 'compose' with sound and visuals simultaneously, i.e. trying to make them both look/sound good at the same time. However this may have been the settings I was initially using, which I refined in further conditions.",so all the colours are fixed; in complex systems the first thing we do is turn all the parameters to the maximum; some of the colours are very similar on the control panel scale switches;takes a second for the brain to make the association between the colour and the note; taking long to get an intuition of the controls; minimum neighbours is the wrong way round;colours are not easily discerable on the (recorded) video as compared to the instrument (itself);quality of the video will likely influence some of the responses;started withtheory then migrated to using the lights;with visual only i felt less connected to why things were happening;one note changed alot; confident is the key word here - i have no idea how the visual look;hard to say which order i did the videos on the rewatch; question of which piece is better is tricky as for one the audio is better and for another the visuals are better;got better with time;audio was frustrating when chaos/chaotic out of control but on reveal it was satisfying to see the lights; as a creative constraint just focusing on one modality is powerful; bringing in the missing modality helps make sense of the bits that didnt work alone; include visual artists/lighting technicians in the who would this be most sutied to; add chrod presets;
4069S,C,B,"Seeing the colours of the notes, reglardless of them being played may have helped build more harmounious sounds. The circles could indicate the colour even when off. Likewise, for someone who doesn't know music, having addition chord selection, aswell as notes, could have been satisfying for someone who doesn't know these chords normally.","The visual structures of sound were more pronounced than I expected.
The relationship between similar colours providing more harmonies was satisfying.
The ability to control the system was greater than my percieved musical skills, however the ability to control the visual block aligned with my ideas of how my brain most effectively processes infomation.
The reviewed videos were more satisfying than I might have imagined. Even if a choatic outcome, having played a part in constructing the light and sound felt like I had some agency and ability to control a somewhat autonomous system.",visual element is not something one would find playing other instruments; considering i have no musical theory i was pleased with my results;
6770L,C,B,"having the panel infront of you than looking down on it from above, would perhaps enable better connection to the instrument. how could we work with beat, more control over rhythm, which is so important - how could you latch on to something rhythmically, and then develop it (rather than loose it very easily) ","the revealed modality for block B went beyond my expectations and so was the bigest mismatch (positive)
my surprise in B and C - noticing that initial glitch in my experience, taking away the visuals, and not realising just how much that was impacting my learning/playing with the instrument . with C, how having the visuals there opened up my creative process, a letting go of expectation, which is a dream when it comes to creating something, to not be tied up in priducing something

doing it in this order ( A, B, C ) was really good for me / satisfying creative experience for me","hey fun - i like the loop function alot; randomness is so unpredictable; decreasing loop length feels really interesting; im not even looking at the panel (AV block) didnt even think about pitch and what scale notes to use on the visual block;frustration not super high becasue i dont understand what im doing yet fully - my expectations (of what i should be able to acheieve) are lower / havent been set yet;epectation of how good you are at something is dependent on your skilll level, frustration comes with expectation; learning happens when frustration is low; ahh its so pretty (visuals); visuals surpised me with their beauty;satisfaction is intersting as i felt in a playful state so satisfaction higher than if i was in a perfomance /product state;wasnt thinking of it as a performance; we (me and instrument) is the dyad <separte to dyad condition!>; mindset shift - not thinking about the audience; same underlying process is a tricky question as i was explicitly trying to make sound and light eel like part of the same process;"
7974C,C,A,Put the interface on one page without scrolling. Have nonlinear scales. ,"The simplest patterns required local density - a repeating cluster or a line across the deck. This very fact of immediate neighbours translated to sound meant busy and unpleasant sounds. I was surprised at the lack of apparent relationship between the visual activity and the complexity of the sound and assume that this is in part because I could not distinguish a significant proportion of note pairings. The layout of the pattern of notes feels like it significantly hampers game of life creatures that sound nice, and I would be very interested in knowing about or playing with different layouts.","i get some of the mechanics of how this works but its chaotic; does the opposite of what i expect, not sure if thats due to the lack of visuals;(reset switch active) its not doing anything i want it to do (power of visual eedback to know whats going on - tricky in a audio only jaming situation to know what you are doing);more instances of visual notes than audible notes;i definataely feel like i understand the visuals more than the audio; pure sine wave might be making the perception of multiple notes harder - stacking of octves is getting perceived as a single note (could be due to the use of pure sine tones - consider using richer timbres for future work);overfitting of patterns to nice sounding chords (would expect a nice visual pattern to sound nice);"
5747E,C,B,"No idea! But overall, it went better than I thought it would - I had no idea what to expect...","It helps if you can hear the audio in your head while usinf the system.  I felt more in control when using both at the same time, but was pleased and a bit surprised with the result of the audio only piece","i dont hear the melodies in my head so dont consider myself a musician, but have experience playing; speak to each other (lights); im obsessed with getting the lights (to group) together; not working; need more wooo; becuase i cant hear the association in my head;at the moment feeling neutral about it;i didnt know how it was going to sound; visuals were a bit sparse but the sound was spacious (conflict between what makes visuals good versus audio good);"
