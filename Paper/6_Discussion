5. Discussion



Exploratory dyad trials (teaser for future study). Two dyad-only pilot trials tested asymmetric modality access: one participant monitored audio via headphones while the other monitored the LED panel, with both negotiating parameter changes in real time. Although the sample is too small for inference, dyad questionnaire ratings were generally high (predominantly 5–6/7 across items), and communication notes describe an emergent division of labour in which one participant tended to “drive” the interface while the other provided evaluative feedback (“try this / try that”) and high-level direction based on the withheld modality. Participants explicitly noted the need to alternate between affective descriptions (“feel”) and parameter-level talk, and to manage turn-taking (when to be quiet versus when to intervene), consistent with the challenge of coordinating from complementary partial information. Across both dyad trials, participants reported moments where improvements in one modality coincided with improvements in the other (e.g., when the sound “worked,” the visual also appeared to cohere), suggesting that the shared state-space can function as a common reference even under split access. In line with solo participants’ reflections that dyad success would likely depend on the relationship and communicative fluency of the pair (rather than on a single “best” modality assignment), a larger counterbalanced dyad study is a promising next step for testing whether distributed access can reliably produce coherent intermedial outcomes and how communication strategy mediates that success.
