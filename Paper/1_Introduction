1. Introduction

Electroacoustic audiovisual composition often aspires to parity between sound and moving image, yet compositional workflows and perceptual salience frequently reintroduce hierarchy—sound functioning as structural “carrier” with image as illustration, or image driving narrative with sound as enhancement. The Organised Sound thematic focus on intermediality intensifies this problem by asking how meaning emerges when media are fused rather than juxtaposed, and how “media equality” might be treated as more than an aesthetic intention.

This article contributes a practice-based empirical study of intermedial composition using a Tonnetz cellular automata (CA) instrument in which sound and LED-panel activity are parallel media projections of a single evolving state-space. The work begins from a simple proposition: when both modalities share generative causality—i.e., when changes to one latent substrate propagate to both sound and light—intermediality becomes a manipulable design problem rather than a post-hoc alignment task. Under this framing, composition is less the authoring of separate sonic and visual layers and more the shaping of state-space dynamics that become perceivable across modalities.

We examine how such coupling supports (or undermines) intermedial equality by manipulating modality access during composition: participants compose under visual-only, audio-only, and audiovisual constraints, then immediately replay the captured excerpt with both modalities present (“the reveal”). This design makes intermedial relations observable at two levels: (i) how participants form intention and steer an autonomous substrate under partial information, and (ii) how the reinstated audiovisual whole is retrospectively interpreted, including whether interference is experienced as productive reinforcement or as cue conflict.

1.1 Intermedial interference as a design and evaluation problem

In generative audiovisual instruments, the relationship between modalities is not fixed by synchronisation alone. It emerges from coupling choices, control affordances, and constraint regimes that shape what participants can perceive and predict while acting. We use intermedial interference to describe the perceptual and interpretive consequences of interactions between salient features of sound and light—e.g., temporal correspondence, density correspondence, salience dominance, and the perceived distribution of agency between human and system. Interference can be constructive (enhancing coherence, legibility, or meaning) or destructive (producing contradiction, masking, or loss of interpretability).

Evaluation remains a practical challenge for practice-based intermedial work: accounts are often compelling but difficult to compare across design choices, and “media equality” is frequently asserted rather than operationalised. The present study aims to produce analysable evidence within realistic artistic development constraints by combining (i) controlled modality-access manipulation, (ii) replay-based reflection, (iii) saved parameter presets and captured artefacts, and (iv) a baseline “system-alone” control capturing intrinsic generativity without human steering.

1.2 Key terms and operational definitions

Because several core terms are used inconsistently across intermedial discourse, this paper adopts the following operational meanings:

Cue: any perceptual feature that participants use to infer system state or structure (e.g., density, repetition, onset grouping, colour clustering, persistence/decay, timbral separability, perceived “busyness”).

Cue reliability: the extent to which a cue provides stable and accurate guidance for prediction and steering in a given context. A cue is “reliable” when similar cue states tend to imply similar system behaviour (supporting intention → action → evaluation); it is “unreliable” when it frequently misleads or varies in meaning across parameter regimes.

Intermedial binding: the experience of sound and light as belonging to a single underlying process rather than two unrelated streams (operationalised via post-reveal items such as “two views of the same underlying process”, coherence/legibility, and causal story plausibility).

Media equality: not mere co-presence, but the negotiated perceptual/interpretive condition in which neither modality is consistently treated as the sole “real” carrier of form; operationalised through balance and dominance reports, reliance on modality-specific cues, and qualitative accounts of hierarchy.

Intermedial interference: constructive or destructive interaction between media features, including reinforcement (cross-modal support) and contradiction/competition (cue conflict, masking, overload).

Agency and autonomy: agency refers to perceived ability to steer toward intention; autonomy refers to the perceived degree to which the system “wants to do its own thing.” Both are treated as co-creative properties rather than purely usability attributes.

These definitions serve two purposes: they make the questionnaire items interpretable as measurements of specific experiential mechanisms, and they allow qualitative accounts to be analysed in terms of cue use, cue conflict, and evolving causal models.

1.3 System overview: Tonnetz cellular automata as an intermedial score

The instrument organises pitch classes on a Tonnetz-derived lattice and drives activation through asynchronous CA dynamics. The evolving CA state is rendered simultaneously as (i) audio output and (ii) LED-panel activity, with fixed mappings between pitch-class admissibility and colour. Participants shape outcomes by adjusting a compact parameter set controlling population bounds, neighbour-rule thresholds, neighbourhood extent (local versus extended), update rate, activation lifetimes, recurrence (looping), and harmonic admissibility (scale). Rather than aligning independent audio and visual layers, the instrument treats both modalities as parallel projections of a shared substrate: when state evolves, sound and light evolve together.

This design intentionally balances steerability with autonomous behaviour. The evaluation problem is therefore not conventional “usability,” but how coupling and constraints support intermedial equality, meaningful fusion, and negotiated authorship under partial information.

1.4 Research questions

The study addresses three primary questions and one exploratory extension:

RQ1 (Intermedial equality): To what extent do participants experience sound and light as co-equal contributors to meaning in a coupled generative system?

RQ2 (Intermedial interference): What forms of constructive and destructive interference arise in practice, and how do they relate to modality access and parameter shaping?

RQ3 (Agency and causality): How do perceived steerability, predictability, and authorship change when one modality is unavailable during composition, and what role does the reveal play in retrospective binding?

RQ4 (Exploratory, distributed access): How do dyads with asymmetric modality access coordinate around a shared parameter interface, and what interaction patterns emerge that may inform future collaborative study designs?

1.5 Methodological approach and evidence strategy (including external ratings)

To operationalise “co-equal media” without reducing the work to preference testing, the study uses a within-subject design: each participant completes three short compositional tasks under visual-only, audio-only, and audiovisual constraints. In all blocks, paired audio/video artefacts are captured and end-state parameter presets saved; participants provide Likert ratings and free-text reflections both pre-reveal and post-reveal, allowing analysis of intention formation, monitoring, and retrospective reinterpretation.

A blinded external rating study is being conducted to triangulate participant experience with artefact-level judgements. Because ratings collection is still ongoing, this paper reports the participant-facing results as the primary evidential base, while documenting the external rating protocol and current completion status in an appendix for transparency and to support follow-on analysis.

1.6 Contributions

This article offers three contributions to intermedial electroacoustic audiovisual practice:

A state-space projection framing of intermedial composition in which sound and light are treated as parallel media projections of a shared generative substrate (an intermedial “score”), avoiding default media hierarchy.

A practical evaluation method suitable for practice-based research under time constraints, combining modality-access manipulation, replay-based reflection, baseline controls, and traceable artefacts (saved presets + captures).

An interference-focused analytic account describing how constructive and destructive interference manifests in this system, and how parameter regimes and modality access relate to perceived fusion, agency, and interpretability.
