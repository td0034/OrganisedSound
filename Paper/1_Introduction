1. Introduction
Electroacoustic audiovisual composition is often discussed through models that implicitly privilege one medium over another: sound interpreted as primary structure with image as illustration, or image interpreted as primary narrative with sound as enhancement. Even where practitioners aim for parity, the practical realities of compositional workflow, interface design and perceptual salience tend to reintroduce hierarchy. This thematic issue calls for approaches that treat sound and moving image as co-equal media within an intermedial space, and for critical accounts of how meaning arises when the media are fused rather than juxtaposed.
This article contributes; a practice-based, empirical study of intermedial composition using a Tonnetz cellular automata (CA) system in which sound and light are generated from a single evolving state-space. The work starts from a simple proposition: if sound and image are projections of the same latent “score”, then intermediality can be addressed not only as an aesthetic aspiration, but as a manipulable design problem. In such a system, relationships between media are not primarily established through post-hoc synchronisation or representational alignment, but through shared generative causality: changes to the underlying state propagate to both modalities. This framing has two implications for intermedial practice. First, it invites a conception of composition as shaping the dynamics of an underlying state-space rather than authoring separate sonic and visual layers. Second, it provides a concrete basis for analysing intermedial interference: constructive and destructive interactions can be observed when the two projections amplify, compete with, or contradict one another in perception.
1.1. Intermedial interference as a design and evaluation problem
In the context of generative audiovisual instruments, intermedial interference can be understood as the perceptual and interpretive consequences of interactions between salient features of the two media: temporal alignment (or misalignment), structural correspondence (or divergence), salience dominance, and the distribution of perceived agency between human and system. In a state-space projection model, interference is not an incidental by-product; it is an emergent property of coupling choices, control affordances and constraint regimes. For example, increasing the update rate or density of events may raise perceived vitality while simultaneously producing attentional overload, shifting the balance of salience between modalities. Similarly, introducing recurrence (looping) may increase structural legibility while reducing the sense of liveness or co-authorship. These tensions are compositional in nature, but they are also evaluable: they manifest in what participants do, what they report experiencing, and what independent listeners/viewers perceive in the resulting artefacts.
Despite the prevalence of generative systems in electroacoustic and audiovisual practices, evaluation is frequently limited to descriptive accounts or anecdotal responses, making it difficult to compare design choices or to articulate how a system supports co-equal media relationships. There remains a need for evaluation approaches that can (i) retain practice-based validity, (ii) produce analysable evidence within realistic artistic development timelines, and (iii) connect participant experience to perceivable properties of the resulting audiovisual artefacts.
1.2. System overview: Tonnetz cellular automata as an intermedial score
The system studied here organises pitch classes on a Tonnetz-derived spatial lattice and drives their activation through asynchronous CA dynamics. The same evolving CA state is rendered simultaneously as (i) audio output and (ii) LED-panel activity, with fixed mappings between pitch-class admissibility and colour. Composition occurs through real-time adjustment of a small set of parameters controlling population bounds, neighbour-rule thresholds, temporal rate, activation lifetimes, neighbourhood extent (local versus extended), recurrence (looping), and harmonic admissibility (scale). Rather than treating sound and light as separate channels to be aligned, the instrument treats them as co-equal surfaces of a single evolving substrate: when the underlying state changes, both modalities change.
This design intentionally blurs boundaries between instrument and environment. On one hand, it affords local interventions and steerability through parameter changes; on the other, it produces autonomous evolution that can surprise and resist direct control. The central evaluation question is therefore not whether the system is “usable” in a conventional sense, but how its coupling and constraints support (or undermine) intermedial equality, meaningful fusion, and negotiated authorship.
1.3. Research questions
The study addresses the following questions:
RQ1 (Intermedial equality): To what extent do participants experience sound and light as co-equal contributors to meaning when composing with the system?


RQ2 (Intermedial interference): What forms of constructive and destructive intermedial interference arise in practice, and how do they relate to modality access and parameter shaping?


RQ3 (Agency and causality): How do participants’ perceptions of authorship, predictability and steerability change when one modality is unavailable during composition?


RQ4 (Distributed authorship, exploratory): Can dyads with asymmetric modality access (one hearing, one seeing) negotiate a coherent intermedial outcome, and how is this outcome perceived by independent raters?


1.4. Methodological approach
To operationalise “co-equal media” without reducing the work to preference testing, the study uses a within-subject design in which each participant completes three short compositional tasks under controlled modality-access conditions: visual-only, audio-only and audiovisual. In all cases, both audio and video are recorded, end-state parameter presets are saved for reproducibility, and participants complete brief post-block measures targeting coherence, novelty, agency, fusion/equality, and constructive versus destructive interference. Immediately after each block, participants replay the captured excerpt with both modalities enabled and provide a short reflection on expectation, fusion and competition. A baseline “system-alone” capture provides a control for the system’s intrinsic generativity.
To relate felt experience to perceivable outcomes, the captured clips are subsequently rated by independent raters drawn from the author’s wider network using blind presentation and standardised scales (preference, coherence, novelty, fusion/equality, overload). Finally, an exploratory dyad variant tests distributed access: one participant composes with audio-only feedback while the other composes with visual-only feedback, negotiating parameter changes verbally to reach a joint outcome.
1.5. Contributions
This article offers three contributions to intermedial electroacoustic audiovisual practice:
A state-space projection framing of intermedial composition in which sound and light are treated as parallel projections of a single generative substrate (an ‘intermedial score’), supporting analysis without default media hierarchy.


An evaluative method suitable for practice-based research under time constraints, combining modality-access manipulation, replay-based reflection, baseline controls and independent rater assessment to connect compositional experience to perceivable artefacts.


An interference-focused analytic account (taxonomy and exemplars) describing how constructive and destructive intermedial interference manifests in this system, and how parameter regimes and modality access relate to perceived fusion, agency and overload.


1.6. Article structure
Section 2 situates the work within intermedial audiovisual composition and generative electroacoustic practices, clarifying how interference and equality are understood in this study. Section 3 details the system and study method, including parameter set, capture protocol and rating procedures. Section 4 reports quantitative and qualitative findings, including within-subject condition effects, baseline comparisons and rater triangulation, alongside an interference taxonomy supported by audiovisual exemplars. Section 5 discusses implications for intermedial instrument design, including practical strategies for balancing autonomy, constraint and salience to support co-equal media relationships.
The audiovisual instrument evaluated here is the TZ5 / Cellular Au-Tonnetz system, previously described in detail as a unified audio-visual MIDI generator that couples Tonnetz pitch-space mapping with cellular automata and a web-configured embedded control architecture. Springer Nature Link+1 That prior publication focuses on system design and demonstration rather than formal evaluation.
The present paper therefore contributes an issue-driven evaluation aligned with Organised Sound’s call for intermediality: specifically, how “media equality” and intermedial interference manifest when participants compose under modality-restricted conditions (visual-only / audio-only / audiovisual) and when outputs are subsequently assessed by independent raters.
