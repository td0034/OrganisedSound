What is this study about?

You are invited to take part in a short study exploring an experimental audiovisual instrument. The instrument generates sound and light patterns together, and you can adjust a small set of controls to shape what it produces. The study looks at how people compose and evaluate outcomes when they can access only the visuals, only the audio, or both together.

Do I have to take part?

No. Taking part is voluntary. You can stop at any time without giving a reason.

Where will it take place?

Location: Unit 68 Mivart Studio, Mivart Street, Easton, Bristol, BS5 6JL
Access: second floor via stairs; toilets on first floor.
Duration: approximately 1 hour.
Note: please bring a warm layer, as the studio can be very cold.
Attendance: maximum two people per session (agree in advance if bringing a guest).

Who can take part?

Adults aged 18+ (for insurance reasons).

You do not need to be a musician.

Please do not take part if:

You have epilepsy.

You believe bright/dynamic light patterns are likely to trigger severe migraine symptoms.

Light warning: the panel may display bright and dynamic patterns. Flicker/strobing may occur to an undefined degree.

What will I do during the session?

You will:

Receive a short briefing and have time to ask questions.

Read this sheet and, if you choose to take part, sign a consent form.

Have a short familiarisation period to learn what the controls do.

Complete three short creative blocks (order varies):

Visual-only: see the light panel; no audio feedback.

Audio-only: hear the system through headphones; panel not visible.

Audiovisual: see and hear the system together.

After each block, complete a short questionnaire.

Finish with a brief optional reflection section.

Optional two-person session (dyad)

If arranged in advance, two participants can attend together. In the dyad task:

One participant hears the audio via headphones but cannot see the panel.

The other participant sees the panel but cannot hear the audio.
You talk to each other and decide together how to adjust the controls, then record one short excerpt and answer a short questionnaire.

What will be recorded?

Audio recording of the instrument output.

Video recording of the light panel from above (panel only).

No photos or video of participants are taken; participant faces are not recorded; participant voices are not intended to be recorded.

A photo of the setup (instrument and studio arrangement) may be taken.

Are there any risks?

Possible risks include:

discomfort from bright/dynamic light patterns (including possible flicker),

discomfort from headphone listening if volume is too high,

fatigue from concentration.

You can:

adjust headphone volume at any time,

ask for breaks,

pause or stop immediately if you feel discomfort or overload,

request reduced brightness.

Benefits

There may be no direct benefit, but some people enjoy trying a new creative instrument. Your input helps improve the system and contributes to research.

How will my data be used and stored?

You will be identified only by a participant code (last 4 digits of your mobile number + initial, e.g., 9746T).

Names/emails are not stored with the research data or shared.

Data (questionnaires, presets, recordings) are stored on the researcher's laptop and backed up to a personal server that is encrypted and protected by two-factor authentication.

Only the researcher has access.

Data may be retained for up to 10 years.

Independent rating of clips

A small number of online raters may view and rate the clips. They will only see the panel video and hear the instrument output.

Withdrawal

You can stop the session at any time. After the session, you can request that your results are withheld within 5 days. After that, data may be anonymised/aggregated and it may not be possible to remove.

How will the results be shared?

Results will be written up for peer-reviewed publication and may contribute to a PhD by publication. Participants will receive a link to the draft paper and, if accepted, the published paper. An anonymised questionnaire dataset may be deposited in a research repository. Clips are not publicly accessible by default; public release would require explicit opt-in.
