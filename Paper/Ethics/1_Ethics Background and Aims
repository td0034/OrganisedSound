Backgrounds and aims of research (max. 300 words)

This project evaluates an experimental audiovisual composition tool that produces sound and light patterns together. Both media are generated from the same underlying rule-based system. Participants shape the system by adjusting a small set of parameters (e.g., density, rate, rule constraints, and permitted pitch classes/colours). The study investigates how participants experience and steer the system when composing with: (1) visual feedback only, (2) audio feedback only, and (3) audiovisual feedback (sound and light together).

A secondary exploratory condition tests collaborative use in pairs (dyads), where two participants co-compose with split access: one participant hears audio via headphones but cannot see the panel, while the other sees the panel but cannot hear the audio. This setup aims to probe how shared reference, negotiation, and perceived control differ when collaboration is routed through colour/pattern judgments versus musical judgments.

Outputs include: (i) saved parameter presets for each participant-created outcome, (ii) recordings of the instrument output (panel video + instrument audio), and (iii) questionnaire responses capturing perceived agency, coherence, novelty, and constructive/destructive "interference" between sound and light. A small set of independent online raters will later view the clips and provide ratings, enabling comparison between participant experience and third-party judgements of the resulting artefacts. Results will be written up for peer-reviewed publication and may contribute to a PhD by publication.

Design and methodology (clear, lay language)

Location: Private studio (address below).

Session length: ~1 hour, one-off session (with potential invitation for future study).

What participants do: adjust a web-based control panel to shape an audiovisual instrument, then record short excerpts.

Main study (solo): each participant completes three short creative blocks, with the order counterbalanced:

Visual-only: participant sees the light panel; audio feedback is removed/masked.

Audio-only: participant hears the sound via headphones; the panel is occluded/hidden.

Audiovisual: participant can see and hear the system.

Each block includes: brief composing period (several minutes), then a short "final capture" recording, then a short questionnaire.

Optional dyad (pair) study: if pre-arranged, two participants co-compose together with split access (one hears only, one sees only), then record one final capture and complete a dyad questionnaire.

Summary of main ethical issues and mitigations

Light sensitivity risks (flicker/dynamic patterns): epilepsy is an exclusion criterion; migraine trigger warning provided; participants can pause, reduce brightness, take breaks, or stop immediately.

Sound exposure (headphones): participants are explicitly told to set a comfortable volume; they can adjust volume at any time; breaks offered.

Consent and withdrawal: written informed consent obtained before participation; participants can stop at any time; participants can request that their results are withheld within 5 days after participation (after this, data may be anonymised/aggregated and removal may not be feasible).

Privacy: recordings capture the instrument output only (overhead view of the LED panel and direct instrument audio). No participant faces are recorded; no participant photos are taken.

Data security: stored on researcher laptop and backed up to a personal server encrypted and protected by 2FA; only the researcher has access.

Studio safety: sessions take place in a private studio environment; basic risk assessment conducted (trip hazards/cables, safe access, awareness of late sessions).

Research locations and approvals

Data collection location: Unit 68 Mivart Studio, Mivart Street, Easton, Bristol, BS5 6JL

Access: second floor via stairs; toilets on first floor.

Approvals: privately hired studio space; no gatekeeper and no additional access approvals required beyond normal access arrangements.

Participant recruitment

Who: adults (18+). Mixed musical and non-musical backgrounds encouraged.

Inclusion criteria: age 18+; able to give informed consent; comfortable with headphone listening.

Exclusion criteria: epilepsy; participants who expect severe migraine/light sensitivity issues are advised not to take part.

Target sample: minimum 6 solo participants (to cover all 6 permutations of block order). Minimum 1 dyad (2 participants).

Raters: target ~5 raters within a short time window (time-limited collection).

How identified: convenience sampling via WhatsApp messages to local personal/professional network. No gatekeeper.

Informed consent

Participants receive a Participant Information Sheet in advance or on arrival.

Written consent collected before starting.

Participants have time to read, ask questions, and decide.

Independent concerns contact: research-governance@bristol.ac.uk

Participants are informed they can stop at any time and can request withholding within 5 days.

Reimbursement / inducement

None.

Misdirection / deception

None.

Participant and researcher safety

Participant risks: discomfort from light patterns; listening fatigue; general overload/fatigue from concentration.

Mitigations: pause/stop any time; reduce brightness; adjust headphone volume; breaks.

Researcher risks: working in private studio, potentially with late sessions. Mitigation: partner aware of schedule; risk assessment completed; limit to max 2 participants per session.

Data management and information security

Data captured: questionnaire responses; saved parameter presets; audio output of instrument; overhead video of LED panel.

Identifiers: participant code only (last 4 digits of mobile number + initial, e.g., 9746T). No names/emails stored with research data.

Storage: laptop + encrypted personal server backup with 2FA; sole researcher access; no developer access.

Retention: up to 10 years.

Withdrawal: request withholding within 5 days.

Research outputs

Intended for peer-reviewed journal submission; may contribute to PhD by publication.

Clips are not publicly accessible by default.

Participants receive a link to the draft paper and (if accepted) published paper.

Anonymised questionnaire dataset to be shared in a repository. Clips may be included only with explicit opt-in for public release.

Supporting information (logistics)
