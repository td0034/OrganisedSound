What is this study about?

You are invited to take part as an independent rater for a study of an experimental audiovisual instrument. The instrument generates sound and light patterns together. We are investigating how resulting clips are perceived by third-party viewers and listeners, and whether the clips reveal the composition condition used by the original participants (audio-only, visual-only, or audiovisual access).

Do I have to take part?

No. Taking part is voluntary. You can stop at any time without giving a reason.

What will I do?

You will:

- Read this information sheet and provide consent online.
- Watch and rate a series of short audiovisual clips.
- Provide ratings on coherence, fusion, interference, and related qualities.
- Optionally leave brief comments.

How long will it take?

Please allow 1-2 hours to complete the task. There are approximately 30 clips, each around 1-2 minutes long. You may take breaks at any time.

What will be recorded?

We will record your ratings for each clip and (for quality control) whether the clip was watched to the end. No personal data are required. If you choose to provide a short rater label, it is only for internal tracking and can be anonymous.

Are there any risks?

Possible risks include:

- fatigue from watching multiple clips,
- listening fatigue if volume is high.

You can pause, take breaks, or stop at any time. Please set a comfortable listening volume.

How will my data be used and stored?

Your ratings will be stored on the researcher's laptop and backed up to a personal server that is encrypted and protected by two-factor authentication. Only the researcher has access. Data may be retained for up to 10 years. Results may be included in peer-reviewed publications or a PhD by publication, but raters will not be identified.

Withdrawal

You can stop the task at any time. If you wish to withdraw your ratings, contact the researcher within 5 days. After that, data may be anonymised and removal may not be possible.
