Backgrounds and aims of research (max. 300 words)

This project evaluates an experimental audiovisual composition tool that produces sound and light patterns together. Both media are generated from the same underlying rule-based system. Participants shape the system by adjusting a small set of parameters (e.g., density, rate, rule constraints, and permitted pitch classes/colours). The study investigates how participants experience and steer the system when composing with: (1) visual feedback only, (2) audio feedback only, and (3) audiovisual feedback (sound and light together).

A secondary exploratory condition tests collaborative use in pairs (dyads), where two participants co-compose with split access: one participant hears audio via headphones but cannot see the panel, while the other sees the panel but cannot hear the audio. This setup aims to probe how shared reference, negotiation, and perceived control differ when collaboration is routed through colour/pattern judgments versus musical judgments.

Outputs include: (i) saved parameter presets for each participant-created outcome, (ii) recordings of the instrument output (panel video + instrument audio), and (iii) questionnaire responses capturing perceived agency, coherence, novelty, and constructive/destructive “interference” between sound and light. A small set of independent online raters will later view the clips and provide ratings, enabling comparison between participant experience and third-party judgements of the resulting artefacts. Results will be written up for peer-reviewed publication and may contribute to a PhD by publication.

Please summarise your design and methodology (clear, lay language)

Location: Private studio (address below).

Session length: ~1 hour, one-off session (with potential invitation for future study).

What participants do: adjust a web-based control panel to shape an audiovisual instrument, then record short excerpts.

Main study (solo): each participant completes three short creative blocks, with the order counterbalanced:

Visual-only: participant sees the light panel; audio feedback is removed/masked.

Audio-only: participant hears the sound via headphones; the panel is occluded/hidden.

Audiovisual: participant can see and hear the system.

Each block includes: brief composing period (several minutes), then a short “final capture” recording, then a short questionnaire.

Optional dyad (pair) study: if pre-arranged, two participants co-compose together with split access (one hears only, one sees only), then record one final capture and complete a dyad questionnaire.

Summary of main ethical issues and mitigations

Light sensitivity risks (flicker / dynamic patterns): epilepsy is an exclusion criterion; migraine trigger warning provided; participants can pause, reduce brightness, take breaks, or stop immediately.

Sound exposure (headphones): participants are explicitly told to set a comfortable volume; they can adjust volume at any time; breaks offered.

Consent and withdrawal: written informed consent obtained before participation; participants can stop at any time; participants can request that their results are withheld within 5 days after participation (after this, data may be anonymised/aggregated and removal may not be feasible).

Privacy: recordings capture the instrument output only (overhead view of the LED panel and direct instrument audio). No participant faces are recorded; no participant photos are taken.

Data security: stored on researcher laptop and backed up to a personal server encrypted and protected by 2FA; only the researcher has access.

Studio safety: sessions take place in a private studio environment; basic risk assessment conducted (trip hazards/cables, safe access, awareness of late sessions).

Research locations and approvals

Data collection location: Unit 68 Mivart Studio, Mivart Street, Easton, Bristol, BS5 6JL

Access: second floor via stairs; toilets on first floor.

Approvals: privately hired studio space; no gatekeeper and no additional access approvals required beyond normal access arrangements.

Participant recruitment

Who: adults (18+). Mixed musical and non-musical backgrounds encouraged.

Inclusion criteria: age 18+; able to give informed consent; comfortable with headphone listening.

Exclusion criteria: epilepsy; participants who expect severe migraine/light sensitivity issues are advised not to take part.

Target sample: minimum 6 solo participants (to cover all 6 permutations of block order). Minimum 1 dyad (2 participants).

Raters: target ~5 raters within a short time window (time-limited collection).

How identified: convenience sampling via WhatsApp messages to local personal/professional network. No gatekeeper.

Informed consent

Participants receive a Participant Information Sheet in advance or on arrival.

Written consent collected before starting.

Participants have time to read, ask questions, and decide.

Independent concerns contact: research-governance@bristol.ac.uk

Participants are informed they can stop at any time and can request withholding within 5 days.

Reimbursement / inducement

None.

Misdirection / deception

None.

Participant and researcher safety

Participant risks: discomfort from light patterns; listening fatigue; general overload/fatigue from concentration.

Mitigations: pause/stop any time; reduce brightness; adjust headphone volume; breaks.

Researcher risks: working in private studio, potentially with late sessions. Mitigation: partner aware of schedule; risk assessment completed; limit to max 2 participants per session.

Data management and information security

Data captured: questionnaire responses; saved parameter presets; audio output of instrument; overhead video of LED panel.

Identifiers: participant code only (last 4 digits of mobile number + initial, e.g., 9746T). No names/emails stored with research data.

Storage: laptop + encrypted personal server backup with 2FA; sole researcher access; no developer access.

Retention: up to 10 years.

Withdrawal: request withholding within 5 days.

Research outputs

Intended for peer-reviewed journal submission; may contribute to PhD by publication.

Clips are not publicly accessible by default.

Participants receive a link to the draft paper and (if accepted) published paper.

Anonymised questionnaire dataset to be shared in a repository. Clips may be included only with explicit opt-in for public release.

Supporting information (logistics)

Session length: ~1 hour.

Please bring a warm layer (studio can be cold).

Maximum two people per session; agree in advance if bringing a guest.

What is this study about?

You are invited to take part in a short study exploring an experimental audiovisual instrument. The instrument generates sound and light patterns together, and you can adjust a small set of controls to shape what it produces. The study looks at how people compose and evaluate outcomes when they can access only the visuals, only the audio, or both together.

Do I have to take part?

No. Taking part is voluntary. You can stop at any time without giving a reason.

Where will it take place?

Location: Unit 68 Mivart Studio, Mivart Street, Easton, Bristol, BS5 6JL
Access: second floor via stairs; toilets on first floor.
Duration: approximately 1 hour.
Note: please bring a warm layer, as the studio can be very cold.
Attendance: maximum two people per session (agree in advance if bringing a guest).

Who can take part?

Adults aged 18+ (for insurance reasons).

You do not need to be a musician.

Please do not take part if:

You have epilepsy.

You believe bright/dynamic light patterns are likely to trigger severe migraine symptoms.

Light warning: the panel may display bright and dynamic patterns. Flicker/strobing may occur to an undefined degree.

What will I do during the session?

You will:

Receive a short briefing and have time to ask questions.

Read this sheet and, if you choose to take part, sign a consent form.

Have a short familiarisation period to learn what the controls do.

Complete three short creative blocks (order varies):

Visual-only: see the light panel; no audio feedback.

Audio-only: hear the system through headphones; panel not visible.

Audiovisual: see and hear the system together.

After each block, complete a short questionnaire.

Finish with a brief optional reflection section.

Optional two-person session (dyad)

If arranged in advance, two participants can attend together. In the dyad task:

One participant hears the audio via headphones but cannot see the panel.

The other participant sees the panel but cannot hear the audio.
You talk to each other and decide together how to adjust the controls, then record one short excerpt and answer a short questionnaire.

What will be recorded?

Audio recording of the instrument output.

Video recording of the light panel from above (panel only).

No photos or video of participants are taken; participant faces are not recorded; participant voices are not intended to be recorded.

A photo of the setup (instrument and studio arrangement) may be taken.

Are there any risks?

Possible risks include:

discomfort from bright/dynamic light patterns (including possible flicker),

discomfort from headphone listening if volume is too high,

fatigue from concentration.

You can:

adjust headphone volume at any time,

ask for breaks,

pause or stop immediately if you feel discomfort or overload,

request reduced brightness.

Benefits

There may be no direct benefit, but some people enjoy trying a new creative instrument. Your input helps improve the system and contributes to research.

How will my data be used and stored?

You will be identified only by a participant code (last 4 digits of your mobile number + initial, e.g., 9746T).

Names/emails are not stored with the research data or shared.

Data (questionnaires, presets, recordings) are stored on the researcher’s laptop and backed up to a personal server that is encrypted and protected by two-factor authentication.

Only the researcher has access.

Data may be retained for up to 10 years.

Independent rating of clips

A small number of online raters may view and rate the clips. They will only see the panel video and hear the instrument output.

Withdrawal

You can stop the session at any time. After the session, you can request that your results are withheld within 5 days. After that, data may be anonymised/aggregated and it may not be possible to remove.

How will the results be shared?

Results will be written up for peer-reviewed publication and may contribute to a PhD by publication. Participants will receive a link to the draft paper and, if accepted, the published paper. An anonymised questionnaire dataset may be deposited in a research repository. Clips are not publicly accessible by default; public release would require explicit opt-in.
