loop on/off button not clear; much prefered the final outcome

you could just spend hours and hours; with the visuals turned off you have no idea; cant remember what anything does now; everytime i try to loop the whole thing stops; cant get anything to sound vaguely nice, not doing jazz anymore; dont have a choice but ot make something that doens sound nice; still dont understand what the parameters are doing; lets try turning them all on; quite a relief (playing without headphones on) because you know (just by looking that) it would be cacophonous; liked it when that blue note came in;emergence - imperfection to allow yourself to play is a good excercise regardless of output; nice to do it without sound;

visual element is not something one would find playing other instruments; considering i have no musical theory i was pleased with my results;

so all the colours are fixed; in complex systems the first thing we do is turn all the parameters to the maximum; some of the colours are very similar on the control panel scale switches;takes a second for the brain to make the association between the colour and the note; taking long to get an intuition of the controls; minimum neighbours is the wrong way round;colours are not easily discerable on the (recorded) video as compared to the instrument (itself);quality of the video will likely influence some of the responses;started withtheory then migrated to using the lights;with visual only i felt less connected to why things were happening;one note changed alot; confident is the key word here - i have no idea how the visual look;hard to say which order i did the videos on the rewatch; question of which piece is better is tricky as for one the audio is better and for another the visuals are better;got better with time;audio was frustrating when chaos/chaotic out of control but on reveal it was satisfying to see the lights; as a creative constraint just focusing on one modality is powerful; bringing in the missing modality helps make sense of the bits that didnt work alone; include visual artists/lighting technicians in the who would this be most sutied to; add chrod presets;

that broke it (in response to momentary switch);sick (in response to rate parameter = 0);i find myslef wanting to understand it all, like what each thing is actually doing, rather than play with it; i want it to go real crazy; it is real crazy that; when its stuck and i add a note it plays all the different octaves; i like it wen it feels more random; with all the lights on its like having the inverse of having just a few on - if i couldnt see the visuals i woulnt know if they were mainly on or off; got some real deepness going on there;i feel the need to make nice music, in scale; when it goes crazy its a bit much but doenst matter if noone else is listening; id like to see units next to the parameters (on the control interface); i didnt get caught in the frustrating loops like can happen with modular synthesisers; interesting that im taking ownership of whats happening; input control (with mouse and web control app) is not amazingly tactile/ergonomic, on synths you can just pop a dial back if you make a mistake; in my head it sounded different, I feel like i should have known it would sound the way it did; my perception changes after answering these questions; i feel like im happy to take credit for it doing stuff when it does what i want it to do; (in response to sound only block) it definately feels like something missing, without the visuals it didnt feel like i was really in control;

rate parameter is counter intuitive, lower is faster; hehe is it possible to break this thing?; is this real time?;somehow stuck on one (light);is this the vidoe? somehow feels different to what i remember (doing);a reset button for the parameters would be great; rate parameter is frustrating;

i dont hear the melodies in my head so dont consider myself a musician, but have experience playing; speak to each other (lights); im obsessed with getting the lights (to group) together; not working; need more wooo; becuase i cant hear the association in my head;at the moment feeling neutral about it;i didnt know how it was going to sound; visuals were a bit sparse but the sound was spacious (conflict between what makes visuals good versus audio good);

hey fun - i like the loop function alot; randomness is so unpredictable; decreasing loop length feels really interesting; im not even looking at the panel (AV block) didnt even think about pitch and what scale notes to use on the visual block;frustration not super high becasue i dont understand what im doing yet fully - my expectations (of what i should be able to acheieve) are lower / havent been set yet;epectation of how good you are at something is dependent on your skilll level, frustration comes with expectation; learning happens when frustration is low; ahh its so pretty (visuals); visuals surpised me with their beauty;satisfaction is intersting as i felt in a playful state so satisfaction higher than if i was in a perfomance /product state;wasnt thinking of it as a performance; we (me and instrument) is the dyad <separte to dyad condition!>; mindset shift - not thinking about the audience; same underlying process is a tricky question as i was explicitly trying to make sound and light eel like part of the same process;

i get some of the mechanics of how this works but its chaotic; does the opposite of what i expect, not sure if thats due to the lack of visuals;(reset switch active) its not doing anything i want it to do (power of visual eedback to know whats going on - tricky in a audio only jaming situation to know what you are doing);more instances of visual notes than audible notes;i definataely feel like i understand the visuals more than the audio; pure sine wave might be making the perception of multiple notes harder - stacking of octves is getting perceived as a single note (could be due to the use of pure sine tones - consider using richer timbres for future work);overfitting of patterns to nice sounding chords (would expect a nice visual pattern to sound nice);
