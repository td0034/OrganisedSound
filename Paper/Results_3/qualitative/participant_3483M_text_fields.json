  "reflection": "For me, the audio had to be removed completely before I could prioritise the visual - the audio was more important to my overall experience - the avoidance of overwhelm and generation of feelings of pleasure or balance.\nAudio only was hardest - perhaps also because I did it first,  but perhaps because I had no other reference point to go by. \nI liked the sense of having control yet also being fully in imperfection and play and surprise.\nI don't really understand the audio-visual relationship but already more than I did at the start. \nIt's magic!\n",
  "session_notes_transcription": "you could just spend hours and hours; with the visuals turned off you have no idea; cant remember what anything does now; everytime i try to loop the whole thing stops; cant get anything to sound vaguely nice, not doing jazz anymore; dont have a choice but ot make something that doens sound nice; still dont understand what the parameters are doing; lets try turning them all on; quite a relief (playing without headphones on) because you know (just by looking that) it would be cacophonous; liked it when that blue note came in;emergence - imperfection to allow yourself to play is a good excercise regardless of output; nice to do it without sound;"
