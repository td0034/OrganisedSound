      "strategy": "understand how I can use the tool to create sound textures. play around with parameters and embrace randomness to achieve something cohesive",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "The lights followed the musical motif as expected. As I could not see the the outcome when composing I tried to produce something musical instead of visual.",
      "interference_notes": "Audio and visuals aligned perfectly."

    "C": {
      "strategy": "play around with the the sounds and visuals to bring together what I have learnt during the experiment. focus was to bring as much variety to the final session",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "I initially found this task less satisfying than my first two attempts. I think this is because while I have a basic understanding of the system, different parameters seeem to feed into the same outcome unless rules are followed. \n\nDespite this I really enjoyed the final playback as there were lots of interesting audio and visual outputs which were partially planned but also unexpected.",
      "interference_notes": "the middle section of the track didnt change much despite me playing around with a lot of parameters, after this by chance I stumbled accross a really interesting motiff which I was really pleased with"

  "one_change": "Incorporate A/D/S/R envelopes into the audio and visuals!",
  "reflection": "Creativity can come from not fully understanding the parameters and playing around\nMusical knowledge and theory is not required to make music and enjoy the creative process\nUsing the system I felt like I was experiencing audio and visual as a combined sense opposed to sensing them separately.\n",
  "session_notes_transcription": "loop on/off button not clear; much prefered the final outcome"
