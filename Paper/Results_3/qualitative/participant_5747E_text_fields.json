      "expectations_vs_outcome": "quite surprising - much better than i thought it would be - didnt have th urge to turn it off after 15seconds, the connection between the audio and visuals isnt in my head - i had no idea how it was going to turn out but still quite please with how turned out",

      "expectations_vs_outcome": "not particularly - at the beginning i thought it was a bit boring but when it got into the different notes and the speed i did rather like it - don't think i could reproduce it ever as its not in my head, not surre sure that i could identify it from a bunch of the other. i wanted to be able to get the ending to resonate and tail off more",
      "interference_notes": "not really - would need to play it more, it might do, "

  "session_notes_transcription": "i dont hear the melodies in my head so dont consider myself a musician, but have experience playing; speak to each other (lights); im obsessed with getting the lights (to group) together; not working; need more wooo; becuase i cant hear the association in my head;at the moment feeling neutral about it;i didnt know how it was going to sound; visuals were a bit sparse but the sound was spacious (conflict between what makes visuals good versus audio good);"
