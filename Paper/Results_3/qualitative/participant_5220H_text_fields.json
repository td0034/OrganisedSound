      "strategy": "I wanted to make it as light as possible to start then bring the light out. I really liked some of the more equal patterns that I/we created. I wanted to have another swing at it, I felt pressure to do something good in the alloted time, where as I didnt feel that in the practice and at the end I liked what I did. ",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "I thought it would sound a bit more chaotic and dissonant, I liked it. But it didn't sound like what I thought it would. I like the bits where I took all the lights out and brought them back in. It was more intense for me being able to hear the sound as well. it ended abuptly, given another chance I feel like i might be able to fade the lights out, but maybe not.",

      "strategy": "I didnt really have a plan kinda just wanted it to sound nice, I found it quick hard to get what was going on. defo felt somthing missing. I found it quite hard",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "It was better than I thought, seeing the visual maybe adds something to it. would have like to end it better, could hacve stopped a little earlier. Without the visuals i felt less in control ",

      "strategy": "I wanted it a bit dissonaty to start with and then more harmonic at the end then fade out. I made this up as i went along",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "I well happyt with that, kinda felt like i was playing it more., For me sound outways visuals and I prefer to control them.",

  "one_change": "I'd add unit to the valves and maybe try and scale them more equally and invert rate.  ",
  "reflection": "I didnt think it would effect how I felt the performace went as much as it did. I felt less in control when I could see it but maybe its a positive bias that i have control when I see it and like it, but im not in control when I cant see it. I think this maybe differnt if I had done the peformances in a differnt order. Still have a question in my mind if I performed or the Tonnetz performed  ",
  "session_notes_transcription": "that broke it (in response to momentary switch);sick (in response to rate parameter = 0);i find myslef wanting to understand it all, like what each thing is actually doing, rather than play with it; i want it to go real crazy; it is real crazy that; when its stuck and i add a note it plays all the different octaves; i like it wen it feels more random; with all the lights on its like having the inverse of having just a few on - if i couldnt see the visuals i woulnt know if they were mainly on or off; got some real deepness going on there;i feel the need to make nice music, in scale; when it goes crazy its a bit much but doenst matter if noone else is listening; id like to see units next to the parameters (on the control interface); i didnt get caught in the frustrating loops like can happen with modular synthesisers; interesting that im taking ownership of whats happening; input control (with mouse and web control app) is not amazingly tactile/ergonomic, on synths you can just pop a dial back if you make a mistake; in my head it sounded different, I feel like i should have known it would sound the way it did; my perception changes after answering these questions; i feel like im happy to take credit for it doing stuff when it does what i want it to do; (in response to sound only block) it definately feels like something missing, without the visuals it didnt feel like i was really in control;"
