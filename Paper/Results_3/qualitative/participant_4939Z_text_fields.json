    "A": {
      "strategy": "Overall strategy was more aimed at achieving pleasant patterns and combinations of colours on the tool (e.g. quickly turning off a colour after turning it on and seeing it doesn't fit). During use of the tool this time I felt like I played more with a narrative associated to the visual display, especially towards the end where I increased the frequency of lights active at one time, followed by an 'ending' which had less and less lights active as the piece was ending.",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "I expected the sound to be more dissonant than it was (i.e. a good matching between tones and light combinations - constructive intereference), this is probably related to the lights being kept on for longer than the associated sound was playing. At times (especially from the middle of the piece to the end) I did not find much association between light duration and note duration - destructive intereference.\nThe shared tonality was surprisingly consonant when colours where matched. When there were dissonant tones playing at the same time, it was more 'interesting' in the sound modality than in the lights modality (e.g. introduction of a green to predominantly purple/red colour combinations).\n\nOverall, the creation of the piece this time was more intuition driven, and I was not 'thinking' about what would sound good given my background music theory knowledge.",
      "interference_notes": "Length of light activity was misleading for tone length which was shorter and did not match. "
    },
    "B": {
      "strategy": "I was aiming for finding pleasant melodies/harmonic movement by individual tones on and off together. I was not focusing on colour matching tones but instead relied on a mixture of trial and error and expectations of what tones would match based on music theory/harmony knowledge.",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "The light modality was more organised than I expected for the majority of the piece, revealing repeated spatial patterns when tones had more pleasing scale intervals. It felt like the pattern of light placements added an extra dimension/dynamicism to the piece, as they shifted between ordered spatially repeating patterns, separated by times of high activity/randomness that corresponded to dissonance and (at those times) overwhelming sound arrangements. \nThe spatial extent of the light patterns (how many lights were active at any one time) were surprising given how few notes were playing (between shifts) - this actually added to the experience as one note playing activated multiple lights it created something more interesting to look at.",
      "interference_notes": "It felt like at times of low sound activity there were more lights active than expected, although as I said, this was a positive in this instance rather than a negative contributor to experiencing the piece. It was less clear why small changes in scale tones used led to large cascades in near-neighbour activation. Essentially it felt like a set of stable ('solid') states separated by high disorganisation in the states ('gas/liquid' states)."

    "C": {
      "strategy": "Find set of parameters that resulted in 'the right' amount of sounds being produced in a given interval\nInitially start with a tone set that I thought would work (based on sounds). Change active tones by removing and adding nearby. During task I was influenced by which sounds to activate/deactivate based on the colour combinations being displayed - aiming for hue-similar colours to be simultaneously active.",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "The result was suprisingly interesting/mesmerising, I could feel my brain try to work out the pattern as well as surprise/'delight' as new patterns of chord tones and colour combinations emerged and changed throughout the piece. The colours on the video were not as easily discernable as when looking at the physical instrument. As I am a musician - my association felt more like light was accompanying the sound, although with longer exposure to the instrument this may change.",
      "interference_notes": "There were moments (when reviewing the piece) when I was surprised by disonance in note tones despite colour combinations produced."
    }
  },
  "one_change": "Having a default settings preset on the controller would be useful. Consider having a few presets that correspond to different audiovisual patterns that users can start from.\n\nThe scale tone colours in the controller do not match the instrument light colours as closely as I would have liked (especially yellow/green on the G/A side were basically identical in the controller). \n\nNote length slider does not correspond to the light activity duration (light carries on after note dies out), consider matching these more closely - adding variable light intensity might be a nice way to do this if changing the lights, or matching the tone duration to make it ring out for longer if changing the tones.",
  "reflection": "On watching back the pieces, what felt most satisfying was the close association between sound and light, rather than coherence of the sound to resemble a piece of music (which I expected beforehand). This said, it was important to have some periods of tonal coherence, because it enabled me to focus in on the more static associations (I think just having high activity/dynamics of light and sound would be overhwelming and not satisfying). \nI think that it would be possible to discern (better than at random) which piece corresponded to which modality being available, based on which modality dominated the experience when reviewing the piece. \nPerhaps it is because of habituation to using the tool, but I felt that when both modalities were available (my first attempt), it was in a sense overwhelming to 'compose' with sound and visuals simultaneously, i.e. trying to make them both look/sound good at the same time. However this may have been the settings I was initially using, which I refined in further conditions.",
  "session_notes_transcription": "so all the colours are fixed; in complex systems the first thing we do is turn all the parameters to the maximum; some of the colours are very similar on the control panel scale switches;takes a second for the brain to make the association between the colour and the note; taking long to get an intuition of the controls; minimum neighbours is the wrong way round;colours are not easily discerable on the (recorded) video as compared to the instrument (itself);quality of the video will likely influence some of the responses;started withtheory then migrated to using the lights;with visual only i felt less connected to why things were happening;one note changed alot; confident is the key word here - i have no idea how the visual look;hard to say which order i did the videos on the rewatch; question of which piece is better is tricky as for one the audio is better and for another the visuals are better;got better with time;audio was frustrating when chaos/chaotic out of control but on reveal it was satisfying to see the lights; as a creative constraint just focusing on one modality is powerful; bringing in the missing modality helps make sense of the bits that didnt work alone; include visual artists/lighting technicians in the who would this be most sutied to; add chrod presets;"
