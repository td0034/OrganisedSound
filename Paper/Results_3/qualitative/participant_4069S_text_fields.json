      "strategy": "Fill the whole grid with lights.\nBuild up a full grid then switch the rate up and down.",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "I expected to be able to have more control over the system, even without sound. I felt this was the case, it was quite clear to understand the impact of my choices and work towards my strategy. \nI don't think I had a strong idea to how the recording would sound and it did sound chaotic. This chaotic sound was satisfying, less because of any typical musical merit, but more the ability to control this.",
      "interference_notes": "No."
    },
    "B": {
      "strategy": "This was more play and experimental.\nMore a/b testing to understand the properties.\nAim to overall build more sounds.",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "The outcome was more satisflying than I felt the recording and playing process went.\nIt felt harder to control the system using purely sound, I think this is because I am a more visual person, however the build up of sound, even if random was fun and on review had more structure than maybe I realised during the process of recording.\nDue to the speed of the lights and output produced, it felt like the sounds and audio had more of an impact. However I felt less in control of the sound during the recording.",
      "interference_notes": "No, it felt coherant. "
    },
    "C": {
      "strategy": "Build up busy space and sound.\nFind and understand harmonies and chords, understand colour patterns and structures.\nPlay with notes to build out and understand melodies.",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "I found the the video review revealed more structures than I expected, particularly the light patterns. With only one minute I initially felt that I may not be able to record anything with typical music structure, however the video and sound did have more musical merit than I thought. This is satisflying as someone who does not consider themselves musical. The visual patterns help reveal the relationships between notes.",
      "interference_notes": "No, however it is possible to witness properties and not understand where they come from or how to control them, within this time frame."
    }
  },
  "one_change": "Seeing the colours of the notes, reglardless of them being played may have helped build more harmounious sounds. The circles could indicate the colour even when off. Likewise, for someone who doesn't know music, having addition chord selection, aswell as notes, could have been satisfying for someone who doesn't know these chords normally.",
  "reflection": "The visual structures of sound were more pronounced than I expected.\nThe relationship between similar colours providing more harmonies was satisfying.\nThe ability to control the system was greater than my percieved musical skills, however the ability to control the visual block aligned with my ideas of how my brain most effectively processes infomation.\nThe reviewed videos were more satisfying than I might have imagined. Even if a choatic outcome, having played a part in constructing the light and sound felt like I had some agency and ability to control a somewhat autonomous system.",
  "session_notes_transcription": "visual element is not something one would find playing other instruments; considering i have no musical theory i was pleased with my results;"
