    "A": {
      "strategy": "thinking about an arc - building a crescendo into chaos ",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "focused on the interface / controls more than the panels, which made the outcome surprising, specifically durations of the transitions and shifts felt slower - feel like i was controlling more on the interface that on the panel - in my head ther was more softness and fluidity beween the states of change between diminuendo and crescendo as thats what was happening on the interface, however the reality was quite different",
      "interference_notes": "because im new to the tool i dont feel that i can get frustrated with it doing or not doing what i want it to - my exectations of the tool are still forming ecasue im still learning "
    },
    "B": {
      "strategy": "a differnet game - brain shift not seeing any visuals - but didnt take long to adapt and get into the sounds world. as soon as the visuals wernt there i really did notice a shift in my engament comapered with audio and visual . really thinking about texture and desity, looping was fundamental, starting wth basic, empty loop, and allowing things to quite slowy become randomised to try and not let go of the loop, keeping it sparse, and then come back to another loop - musical container, some sense of predicatability, how would you make an audience feel safe in this sound - felt like a repetition is how that could be acheived.",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "i had no expecaton of what the visulas should be - but when i saw it it was so beautiful, in a way that i wasnt aware of the opposite way round (previous block visual to audio reveal) in focusing on the visuals i wasnt able to achieve waht i wanted, but focussing on the sound world i was abel to acheive what i wanted. hence the frustration - when the system didnt do what i wanted to do, it was not surprising that the visuals where also displeaseing at that moment.",
      "interference_notes": "no"
    },
    "C": {
      "strategy": "felt more at ease in not having an artisitic plan - i also have a phrase in my head - there something like a collaboration working with the instrumennt, more acceptance, a level of curiosity not trying to control it as much, had to remind myself to keep looking at the visuals, but i have mush more of an affinity with sound and that felt obvious to me. found it really fun, noticing my personal preferneces and happy to lean in to them, , feeling like personal voice come through",
      "expectations_vs_outcome": "felt super locked into it - progression from audio to video to both. having no set idea of what i wanted to create, felt most creatively satisfied with this one, collaboration and acceptance of ewhat happened - th instrument was able to give me some ideas that were interesting, less latched on to my own creation and able to work along side the tool. something intersting about having created the the two modalities together - on the rewatch i wasnt looking out for mismatches tso could really lock into it  ",
      "interference_notes": "no"
    }
  },
  "one_change": "having the panel infront of you than looking down on it from above, would perhaps enable better connection to the instrument. how could we work with beat, more control over rhythm, which is so important - how could you latch on to something rhythmically, and then develop it (rather than loose it very easily) ",
  "reflection": "the revealed modality for block B went beyond my expectations and so was the bigest mismatch (positive)\nmy surprise in B and C - noticing that initial glitch in my experience, taking away the visuals, and not realising just how much that was impacting my learning/playing with the instrument . with C, how having the visuals there opened up my creative process, a letting go of expectation, which is a dream when it comes to creating something, to not be tied up in priducing something\n\ndoing it in this order ( A, B, C ) was really good for me / satisfying creative experience for me",
  "session_notes_transcription": "hey fun - i like the loop function alot; randomness is so unpredictable; decreasing loop length feels really interesting; im not even looking at the panel (AV block) didnt even think about pitch and what scale notes to use on the visual block;frustration not super high becasue i dont understand what im doing yet fully - my expectations (of what i should be able to acheieve) are lower / havent been set yet;epectation of how good you are at something is dependent on your skilll level, frustration comes with expectation; learning happens when frustration is low; ahh its so pretty (visuals); visuals surpised me with their beauty;satisfaction is intersting as i felt in a playful state so satisfaction higher than if i was in a perfomance /product state;wasnt thinking of it as a performance; we (me and instrument) is the dyad <separte to dyad condition!>; mindset shift - not thinking about the audience; same underlying process is a tricky question as i was explicitly trying to make sound and light eel like part of the same process;"
