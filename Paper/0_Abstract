Electroacoustic audiovisual composition often aspires to parity between sound and moving image, yet compositional workflows and perceptual salience frequently reintroduce hierarchy, positioning one medium as structural and the other as illustrative. Responding to calls to reconceptualise media relationships through intermediality, this article examines intermedial interference—constructive and destructive interactions between media features—as an evaluable property of generative audiovisual instruments. We study a Tonnetz cellular automata (CA) system in which sound and LED-panel activity are parallel projections of a single evolving state-space. Participants shaped the system by adjusting a compact parameter set governing population bounds, neighbourhood extent, neighbour-rule thresholds, update rate, activation lifetimes, recurrence (looping), and harmonic admissibility (scale). Using a within-subject design, each participant completed three short compositional tasks under controlled modality-access conditions (visual-only, audio-only, audiovisual). In all conditions, both audio and video were recorded and end-state parameter presets saved. Participants reported satisfaction, intention, steerability, intermedial coherence, balance, autonomy, and interference, followed by immediate replay-based reflection with both modalities present. We outline an analysis framework linking compositional experience to captured audiovisual artefacts and propose an interference taxonomy grounded in parameter regimes and observed strategies (e.g., density shaping, looping, and scale manipulation). A blinded external rating study of the resulting clips is underway to triangulate participant experience with artefact-level judgements. The study offers a practical evaluation method for practice-based intermedial research and a state-space projection framing of audiovisual composition as parallel media projections of a shared generative substrate.
