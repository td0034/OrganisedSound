Definitions and operationalisations

This study concerns intermedial composition using a coupled audio–light instrument whose behaviour is generated by a shared cellular-automata substrate mapped onto a Tonnetz-derived pitch space. To avoid equivocation, we define the following terms as used throughout the paper.

Modality and condition

A modality is a perceptual channel through which the instrument discloses system state and output. In this study the relevant modalities are auditory (sound output) and visual (light output).

A condition is a composition phase defined by which modalities were available during performance:

A (Visual-only): participants composed with lights available but without sound.

B (Audio-only): participants composed with sound available but without lights.

C (Audio+Visual): participants composed with both sound and lights available.

Reveal

The reveal is the post-performance replay in which both modalities are presented, regardless of which modality was available during composition. Empirically, the reveal is treated as a site of retrospective interpretation (re-assessing intention, outcome quality, and the perceived coupling between modalities).

Intermediality

We use intermediality to mean the experienced sense that sound and light are two views of a single generative process, rather than independent layers or loosely synchronised outputs. This is operationalised primarily via:

B1 (“two views of the same underlying process”),

B2–B4 (balance/coherence/constructive reinforcement),
and is triangulated with end-of-session judgements (e.g., “most intermedial” selection and qualitative reflections).

Interference

We use intermedial interference to describe how the relationship between modalities either supports or undermines interpretation and control.

Constructive interference: sound and light mutually reinforce each other as evidence for “what is happening” and “what my actions did” (captured by B3–B4, and by qualitative reports of clarity, alignment, and emergent coherence).

Destructive interference: sound and light compete, contradict, or imply incompatible causal/temporal relations (captured by B5, and by qualitative reports of mismatch, misleading cues, or competing demands on attention).

Interference is treated as valenced: mismatch can be negative (blocking prediction/control) or positive (surprising, revealing latent structure).

Cue, cue reliability, and cue conflict

A cue is any perceivable feature participants treat as evidence for inference and decision-making during interaction (e.g., visual density, spatial motifs, temporal persistence; auditory event rate, pitch content, envelope clarity; or cross-modal synchrony).

Cue reliability refers to how consistently a cue tracks the underlying system state in a way that supports prediction and steering. A cue is reliable when it repeatedly affords the inference “if I do X, Y will happen”; it is unreliable when the same cue pattern corresponds to multiple outcomes or routinely misleads.

A cue conflict occurs when cues—within a modality or across modalities—support incompatible interpretations (e.g., light persistence implying sustained tone when the note has already released; sparse visuals coinciding with perceptually busy sound). Cue conflict is a specific mechanism through which destructive interference can occur.

Steerability, monitoring, autonomy, and agency

Steerability is the participant’s perceived ability to guide the system toward an intention while composing (operationalised by A3, supported by strategy descriptions and parameter narratives).

Monitoring refers to the ability to maintain a usable internal model of current system state during performance (qualitatively prominent in audio-only reports; closely related to cue availability/reliability).

Autonomy refers to the perceived degree to which the system exhibits self-directed behaviour rather than behaving as a transparent instrument (operationalised by B10, and reflected in authorship/attribution language such as “did I perform or did the Tonnetz perform”).

Agency is used in the broad sense of felt authorship and effective action within a coupled human–system interaction. In this framing, agency is not equivalent to full control: participants can report high agency under conditions of partial unpredictability when the system remains interpretable and responsively steerable.

Media balance

Media balance (sometimes discussed as “media equality”) refers to whether participants experience sound and light as comparable carriers of form, rather than one modality serving merely as accompaniment (operationalised by B2, and supported by qualitative reports of attentional dominance and modality hierarchy).
